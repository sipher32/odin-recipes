    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough (Baker’s %)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>560 grams of flour</li>
        <li>335 grams of water (60%)</li>
        <li>17 grams of sea salt (3%)</li>
        <li>11 grams of sugar (2%)</li>
        <li>11 grams of barley malt (2%)</li>
        <li>11 grams of extra virgin olive oil (2%)</li>
        <li>1 gram of active dry yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A lot of people use 00 and go for very high hydration dough. I highly recommend bread flour - local if you have a mill nearby - 
        and keeping your hydration between 58 and 62 percent.</p>
    <p>*The malt is optional and helps with browning and to strengthen the dough for longer fermentation. If you don’t have it, you can 
        omit it and still make great pizza.</p>
    <h4>Pizza</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For added flavor and crispness, I like to start with a preferment, using 150 grams water, 150 grams flour, 
            and 1 gram of active dry yeast. Seems fancy and advanced, but it’s super simple and only takes a few minutes 
            to prepare! Mix with a dinner fork in a tall deli container until blended, seal, and rest at room temperature 
            for 3-5 hours. The mixture will triple in volume. Place in the refrigerator for roughly 12 hours. If you want 
            to skip this step, you can! You’ll still make great pizza.</li>
        <li>For the main dough, add 185 grams of room temperature water into a mixing bowl. Use a spatula to gently add 
        the cold preferment. Turn the mixer on low speed for one minute. The water should become milky white, and you 
        don’t need to achieve a smooth consistency at this step.</li>
        <li>[If you skipped the preferment, you’ll be using the full 335 grams of water here, and also adding the 1 gram 
        of yeast at this step.]</li>
        <li>Stop the mixer and add the remaining 410 grams of flour [560 grams if you skipped the preferment]. Begin to 
        mix on low speed again, and slowly sprinkle the sugar, salt, and malt into the dough, allowing it to distribute 
        evenly. Mix for 8-10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and cleaning the sides of the mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and turn the mixer up to medium speed to finish mixing. The dough is ready when the oil has been 
        incorporated. If you don’t have olive oil, other oils will work, too, but each will have their own flavor (or 
        no flavor at all).</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean counter, and knead by hand for 1 to 2 minutes to form a large, smooth ball. You 
        shouldn’t have to use any added flour or oil. The dough should be easy to work.</li>
        <li>Cover with the mixing bowl, turned upside down, and rest for 5 hours.</li>
        <li>After the rest, remove the bowl and divide the dough into two equal parts, roughly 460 grams each. Ball the 
        dough until smooth and tight, seal the bottom with a pinch, and place into large, lightly oiled deli containers 
        or tupperware to ferment in the fridge.</li>
        <li>The pizza dough can stay in the fridge for several days, and will become more flavorful and aromatic the longer 
        you allow it to ferment. My ideal target time for the cold ferment is 24 to 72 hours.</li>
        <li>When you’re ready to make pizza, remove the dough from the fridge and allow to rest at room temperature for 3 
        hours before stretching.</li>
        <li>For cheese, you can use whatever blend you like, but traditionally NY style calls for whole milk, low moisture 
        mozzarella shredded from a block. I prefer blending in some provolone for flavor, again shredded by hand.</li>
        <li>I use 7 ounces of cheese for a 16” pizza and add it to the pizza when cold. This pizza was made with Grande 
        mozzarella and Belgioioso provolone.</li>
        <li>The sauce is a simple raw tomato using a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. I really like Bianco DiNapoli or 
        Sclafani if you can find them. If not, I recommend experimenting with a few good brands. Quality and taste 
        vary wildly, and make a real difference. You can crush your own whole tomatoes, but many brands pack them in 
        not so great juice that you’ll need to drain and then adjust to season properly.</li>
        <li>To the tomatoes, add one teaspoon of sea salt, one half teaspoon sugar (optional), and a small amount of dried 
        basil, dried oregano, red pepper, and black pepper. Garlic and olive oil are also great additions.</li>
        <li>Blend the sauce in advance and store in a sealable container, not the can. I recommend 5-6 ounces of sauce for 
        a 16” pizza. One 28 ounce can will be enough for about 5-6 pizzas and it keeps for a week in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven for one hour at 500 to 550 degrees Fahrenheit with a stone or steel positioned on the middle 
        rack.</li>
        <li>Get all of your toppings ready, so you can work quickly to stretch, top, and launch your pizza without the dough 
        sticking to the peel. Gotta go fast!</li>
        <li> <a href="https://youtu.be/GtAeKM_f2WU">How to Stretch a Pizza Dough (YouTube)</a></li>
        <li>I prefer fine Semolina flour for the stretch. It doesn’t add flavor and helps the pizza slide nicely off the peel 
        with no sticking.</li>
        <li>After stretching, add the sauce to the center of the shell and gently spread outward in a spiral, leaving room 
        at the outer edge for a 1/2” to 1” crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle Parmesan or Romano cheese over the sauce and if you like, you can add additional dried oregano here or 
        after the mozzarella (or both!). Crush the oregano in your palm before you add it to gain entry to Flavor Town.</li>
        <li>Add your cheese, from edge to the center, covering all the sauce and distributing it evenly. Add any other toppings 
        you want, being careful not to overload the pizza. Pineapple is cool if you’re into it. Your pizza. Your toppings.</li>
        <li>Launch your pizza and cook it!</li>
        <li>The lower the temperature, the longer your bake time will be, ranging from 6 to 10 minutes. If you like a darker 
        crust, or need more top heat to finish the cheese, you can use a broiler for the last 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the 
        pizza once or twice to make sure it gets an even bake. Most ovens have hot spots.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza when it’s finished to your liking and allow it to cool on a wire rack to keep the base crispy 
        and to prevent the roof of mouth from being absolutely annihilated by molten hot cheesy goodness. After five to 
        seven minutes, slice it into eight pieces and eat it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Share if you’re feeling generous.</p>
    <p>Enjoy your pizza!</p>
